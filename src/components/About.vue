						Ohayo! üëãüèæ My name is Anthony Akpan. I am a Frontend Engineer who loves building crazy ideas and trying out new things.
						I got into programming in 2015 when I found a Python e-book and then switched from Python to Web Development in 2017.
					</p>

					<p>
						Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with amazing companies and people, and on diverse projects.
						<br />I recently started a YouTube channel which is focused on documenting my Passion Projects (open source projects I work on) and my journey in tech.
						<br />When I am not writing code, I am usually binging an anime/TV series.
						<br />PS: I looove One Piece. It's all you want in an anime (interesting and non-endingüòÇ).
